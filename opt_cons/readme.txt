About the data

The data is divided into three folders: optical constants (n_k, 16 files), the minimum value of the optical constants (min_n_k, 16 files), and the original spectra (54 files). 

All optical constant files are tab-delimited text.  The first 6 lines begin with a "3" and are comments about the data.  The first line is the title, the next two lines are input values for for n and d, followed by the final value for n (at 2.63 micrometers) and the number of iterations for the run.  The last line is the titles of the data columns.  The data are presented in four columns: Wavelength (micrometers), n, k, and T (Transmittance).  

The naming convention for the files is: phase_temperature.txt.  For example, crystalline h2o-ice at 20 K is crys_20K.txt.  The files that begin with "min" are the minimum values for the corresponding spectrum.  That is, the minimum value spectra for 20 K crystalline h2o-ice is min_crys_20K.txt.  Instead of numbers, the amorphous h2o-ice files are either high or low temperature. 

Also included with the data are the original spectra used for the calculation in the folder: original_spectra. These files consist of two columns of tab-delimted text.  The first column is frequency in wavenumbers (1/cm) and the second column is % transmission. These spectra have not been baseline corrected or had the infrared interference fringes removed.  For each set of optical constants, several spectra were averaged, resulting in a single spectrum. The spectra used for a given temperature and phase are listed below.
