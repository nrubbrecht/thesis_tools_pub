# thesis_tools_pub

This repository contains the tools and methods developed for my master’s thesis on exploring optical phenomena within Enceladus’ plumes from Cassini ISS and VIMS observations. These phenomena were analysed using Mie theory simulations and geometries retrieved from SPICE. Details on the development of these tools can be found in the appendix of the thesis report available at https://repository.tudelft.nl/.

Before running any simulations, add these larger kernels to the 'kernels/spk/' folder:
